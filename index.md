I am [Chief Research Scientist](https://www.simula.no/people/meg) in
the [Department of Numerical Analysis and Scientific
Computing](https://www.simula.no/research/research-departments/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing)
at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no) in Oslo, Norway
and Deputy Director of the [K. G. Jebsen Centre for Brain Fluid
Research](https://www.med.uio.no/klinmed/forskning/sentre/kg-jebsen-hjerneveske/index.html).

My research focuses on numerics for partial differential equations, high-performance mathematical software, and high-fidelity modeling of
excitable tissue, targeting frontier research both in
computational mathematics and in the neurosciences. For publications
and bio, see Marie E. Rognes at [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BHyQJSAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6872-3710). For a 2025 presentation of key lines of current research, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17093210">Brain membranes and vasculature: a computational mathematics tale of dimensional gaps</a>.

I have been a core developer (2007--2024) and Steering Council Member
(2016--2024) of the [FEniCS Project](https://www.fenicsproject.org)
and a founding member of the
[Dolfin-adjoint](https://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/) project
(2011--).

Our research project [Exciting times: extreme modelling of excitable tissue (EMIx)](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/exciting-times-extreme-modelling-excitable-tissue-emix) recently ended. For a high-level glimpse into our activities, see: [EMIx in a nutshell (pdf)](https://meg-simula.github.io//files/emix-in-a-nutshell.pdf).
