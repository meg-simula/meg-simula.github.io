I am a [Chief Research Scientist](https://www.simula.no/people/meg) in
the [Department of Numerical Analysis and Scientific
Computing](https://www.simula.no/research/research-departments/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing)
at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no) in Oslo,
Norway.

My research spans applied and computational mathematics, scientific
computing and computational physiology, targeting dual scientific
impact in mathematics and in the life sciences.

I currently lead the [Exciting times: extreme modelling of excitable
tissue
(EMIx)](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/exciting-times-extreme-modelling-excitable-tissue-emix)
project funded by a Research Council of Norway FRIRRO Research Grant. My former
research projects include 

 - [Mathematical and Computational Foundations for modelling cerebral fluid flow (Waterscales)](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/waterscales-mathematical-and-computational-foundations-modeling-cerebral-fluid), a European Research Council Starting Grant, PE1/Mathematics (2016-2023)
