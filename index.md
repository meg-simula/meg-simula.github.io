I am a [Chief Research Scientist](https://www.simula.no/people/meg) in
the [Department of Numerical Analysis and Scientific
Computing](https://www.simula.no/research/research-departments/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing)
at [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no) in Oslo,
Norway.

My research spans applied and computational mathematics, scientific
computing and computational physiology, targeting dual scientific
impact in mathematics and in the life sciences. 




Current research projects:
 - [Exciting times: extreme modelling of excitable tissue (EMIx)](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/exciting-times-extreme-modelling-excitable-tissue-emix), a Research Council of Norway (RCN) FRIRRO Researcher project for scientific renewal (2021-2025) 
 - [AUTORHYTHM â€“ the role of autophagy in healthy aging](https://www.uio.no/english/research/strategic-research-areas/life-science/research/convergence-environments/autorhythm/), a life science convergence environment (2022-2026) 

Key former research projects include
 - [Mathematical and Computational Foundations for modelling cerebral fluid flow (Waterscales)](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/waterscales-mathematical-and-computational-foundations-modeling-cerebral-fluid), a European Research Council Starting Grant in PE1/Mathematics (2016-2023). About the project: [Rognes, Waterscales, Eur. Math. Soc. Mag. 126 (2022)](https://euromathsoc.org/magazine/articles/115)
 - [The Numerical Waterscape of the Brain](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/waterscape-numerical-waterscape-brain), a RCN FRIPRO Young Research Talent Grant (2016-2019)
 - [Automated uncertainty quantification for numerical solution of partial differential equations](https://www.simula.no/research/projects/auq-pde-automated-uncertainty-quantification-numerical-solutions-partial), a Nordic Council of Ministers Research Grant (2015-2018)
